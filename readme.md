# Basics of GitHub and Git

## Introduction

**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects and track changes to files over time. **GitHub** is a platform built around Git that provides additional features such as hosting repositories online, collaboration tools, and version control.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Version Control

Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. It allows teams to:

- Track modifications: See who changed what, when, and why.
- Revert changes: Roll back to a previous version if needed.
- Maintain consistency: Ensure everyone is working on the latest version of files.

### 2. Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed for speed and efficiency. It operates locally on your computer, making it fast and capable of handling both small and large projects effectively. Key features of Git include:

- **Snapshots**: Git captures a snapshot of your files whenever a change is made, rather than storing incremental differences.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows for branching (creating separate lines of development) and merging branches back together. This enables parallel development and feature isolation.
- **Distributed Development**: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history. This allows work to continue offline and facilitates collaboration.

### 3. GitHub

GitHub enhances Git by providing a centralized platform for collaboration and project management. Key features of GitHub include:

- **Hosting Repositories**: GitHub hosts your Git repositories in the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Pull Requests**: Developers can propose changes (pull requests) and discuss them before merging into the main branch.
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub provides tools for issue tracking, allowing teams to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub facilitates collaboration through features like code reviews, project wikis, and team management.


# Introduction to Conda and Mamba
Bioinformatics involves the application of computational methods and tools to analyze biological data. Managing software dependencies and environments is crucial in bioinformatics to ensure reproducibility, manage complex dependencies, and facilitate collaboration. Mamba and Conda are powerful tools that address these needs effectively.

## What are Conda and Mamba?

**Conda** and **Mamba** are package and environment managers for the Python programming language (and other languages). They facilitate the installation, management, and deployment of software packages and environments.

- **Conda**: Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda also creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer.

- **Mamba**: Mamba is a reimplementation of the Conda package manager in C++. It aims to be a faster and more efficient alternative to Conda, especially when dealing with large dependency graphs or when performing operations like environment resolution and package installation.

## Why Use Conda or Mamba?

1. **Ease of Installation**: Conda and Mamba simplify the installation of bioinformatics software. Many bioinformatics tools and libraries are available as Conda packages, which can be installed with a single command. This eliminates the need for manual dependency resolution and reduces the chances of installation errors.

2. **Managing Complex Software Dependencies Using Isolated environments**: Bioinformatics projects often require multiple software packages with specific versions. Conda and Mamba excel at managing these dependencies, allowing bioinformaticians to create isolated environments where each project can have its own set of dependencies without interfering with others.

3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it suitable for collaborative projects across different operating systems.

4. **Conda-forge**: A community-driven repository of Conda packages that provides additional packages and versions beyond the default Anaconda repository.

## Installing Conda/Mamba

1. **Miniforge**: Miniforge is a minimal installer for Mamba and Conda. It includes Mamba, Conda, Python, and other essential packages needed for these to function. You can download it from [Miniforge website](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and install it using the instructions provided for your platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux).


## Using Conda and Mamba

### Creating Environments

You can create a new environment with specific packages like this:

```bash
mamba create -n myenv python=3.8 numpy pandas
```
Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name.  

### Create an Example Bioinformatics Environment

Create a new Conda environment for a bioinformatics project:

```bash
mamba create -n bioinfo_env python=3.8 biopython pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Managing Environments
Activate an environment

```bash
conda activate bioinfo_env
```

Deactivate an environment

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### Installing Packages
Install a package in the active environment

```bash
conda activate bioinfo_env
mamba install -c bioconda bowtie2 samtools seaborn
```

### Managing Packages
Update a package
```bash
mamba update numpy
```
Remove a package
```bash
mamba remove scipy
```

### Searching for Packages
Search for packages
```bash
mamba search r
```

### Sharing Environments
Export the environment to a YAML file for sharing or reproducibility:

```bash
mamba env export > bioinfo_env.yml
```

## Example of running a tool in a conda environment
An example command using a bioinformatics tool to generate a visual output. We'll use `matplotlib`, which is a popular plotting library in Python often used in bioinformatics for visualizing data.

```bash
# Activate your bioinformatics environment (assuming it's already created)
conda activate bioinfo_env

# Create a Python script (e.g., microbiome_heatmap.py) to generate a heatmap
# Here's a script that simulates microbiome data and creates a heatmap:

echo '
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Simulate microbiome data (relative abundance of microbial species across samples)
# Example data: 10 samples (x-axis) and 5 microbial species (y-axis)
num_samples = 10
num_species = 5

# Generate random data representing relative abundance (%)
data = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_species) * 100

# Create heatmap using seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu", cbar=True)

plt.title("Microbiome Data: Heatmap of Relative Abundance")
plt.xlabel("Microbial Species")
plt.ylabel("Sample")
plt.xticks(np.arange(num_species) + 0.5, [f"Species {i+1}" for i in range(num_species)])
plt.yticks(np.arange(num_samples) + 0.5, [f"Sample {i+1}" for i in range(num_samples)], rotation=0)
plt.tight_layout()

# Save the plot as microbiome_heatmap.png
plt.savefig("microbiome_heatmap.png")
plt.show()
' > microbiome_heatmap.py

# Run the script to generate the heatmap
python microbiome_heatmap.py
```
Explanation of the commands:
- `conda activate bioinfo_env`: Activates the Conda environment `bioinfo_env` where `seaborn` is installed.
- **Heatmap (`microbiome_heatmap.py`)**:
   - Uses `seaborn` to create a heatmap of microbiome data.
   - Simulated data represents relative abundance of microbial species across samples.
   - Colors in the heatmap represent the abundance levels, with annotations showing exact values. 

After running these commands, you should have a file named `microbiome_heatmap.png` in your current directory, which is a visual output created using `seaborn` within the bioinformatics environment managed by Conda.

## Conclusion

Conda and Mamba are powerful tools for managing software environments and packages in Python. Whether you are working on data science, machine learning, or any other Python-based project, mastering these tools will streamline your workflow and ensure reproducibility across different computing environments.
